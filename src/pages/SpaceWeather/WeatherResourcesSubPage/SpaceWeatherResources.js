    // General FAQs...
    { question: "What causes geomagnetic storms?", answer: "Geomagnetic storms are caused by disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere due to solar winds and solar phenomena like coronal mass ejections (CMEs)." },
    { question: "How do solar flares affect Earth?", answer: "Solar flares can affect Earthâ€™s ionosphere and disrupt radio communications, GPS coordinates, and power grids." },

    // FAQs for research scientists
    { question: "What tools are used for space weather research?", answer: "Researchers use a variety of tools including satellites, ground-based observatories, and computer models to study and predict space weather events." },
    { question: "How does space weather impact climate research?", answer: "Space weather affects Earth's upper atmosphere and can contribute to climate variability, making it an important factor in climate research." },
    { question: "What are the current challenges in space weather prediction?", answer: "Challenges include accurately predicting the timing and impact of solar events, understanding the interaction between solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, and improving the models used for forecasts." },

    // Kid-friendly FAQs
    { question: "Can you see space weather?", answer: "Yes! The Northern and Southern Lights, known as auroras, are visible displays caused by space weather." },
    { question: "Is space weather dangerous?", answer: "Space weather can affect satellites and power systems, but we're safe from its direct effects here on Earth thanks to our planet's magnetic field and atmosphere." },
    { question: "What are sunspots?", answer: "Sunspots are cooler, darker areas on the Sun's surface. They can be a sign of solar activity like solar flares." },
